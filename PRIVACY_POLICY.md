## Maya Dark Icon Pack: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Maya Petrol Icon Pack app for Android!

This is an Android icon pack developed by Luciano Horta. The app is available on Google Play and was based on the great framework Blueprint (https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge and sell data to third parties.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
